The boys Junior State League (JSL) will remain unchanged. Further information available at point 9. \\n1.8 The age divisions which participate in the Youth Club Championship Structure are the Under 13, 14, 15 and 16’s for boys \\nand girls. All other age divisions will remain, including the Under 17 competition, but will not form part of the Club \\nChampionship structure. \\n1.9 Football SA will develop and provide the full Operating Regulations for this competition prior to the nomination period \\nopening.'),\n",
